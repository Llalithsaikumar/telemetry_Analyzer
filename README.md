## About the Project

This repository contains the code for the Telemetry Analyzer, a project designed to [**Describe the main goal of the project in 1-2 sentences. E.g., "process and analyze complex telemetry streams from IoT devices," or "monitor system health and detect potential failures early."**]. It utilizes machine learning techniques to automate the identification of [**mention what it identifies, e.g., "anomalous behavior," "performance bottlenecks," "resource utilization trends," etc.**], thereby providing valuable insights into the performance and stability of the monitored systems.

The core problem this project aims to solve is [**Explain the specific problem this project addresses. For example, "the manual and time-consuming process of sifting through vast amounts of telemetry data," or "the difficulty in proactively identifying issues before they impact users."**].

## How the ML Model Works

The machine learning model at the heart of this Telemetry Analyzer is responsible for [**Explain the ML model's role. E.g., "identifying deviations from normal operating patterns," or "classifying telemetry events into different categories."**].

### Model Type

The model used is a [**State the type of ML model, e.g., "Isolation Forest," "Autoencoder," "LSTM," "XGBoost Classifier," "K-Means Clustering," etc.**].

### Training Data

The model is trained on [**Describe the type of data used for training. E.g., "historical telemetry data representing normal system behavior," "labeled datasets of healthy and anomalous telemetry," etc.**]. The training dataset includes features such as [**List some key features/columns from your training data, e.g., "CPU usage," "memory consumption," "network latency," "error rates," "timestamp," etc.**].

### Feature Engineering

Before feeding data to the model, the following feature engineering steps are performed:
* [**Describe Feature Engineering Step 1. E.g., "Time-series decomposition to extract trend, seasonality, and residual components."**]
* [**Describe Feature Engineering Step 2. E.g., "Normalization/Standardization of numerical features."**]
* [**Describe Feature Engineering Step 3. E.g., "Creation of rolling averages or other statistical features."**]
* [**Describe Feature Engineering Step 4 (if applicable). E.g., "Categorical encoding (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding)."**]

### Model Architecture and Training Process

[**Provide details about the model's architecture (if applicable, especially for neural networks).**]
* **For Supervised Learning:**
    * The training process involves [**Explain the training objective and algorithm. E.g., "minimizing the reconstruction error for autoencoders," or "classifying data points as 'normal' or 'anomaly' using a supervised learning algorithm."**].
    * The model learns to [**What does the model learn? E.g., "learn the underlying distribution of normal telemetry data," or "distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns based on labeled examples."**].
    * [**Mention any specific training parameters, e.g., "epochs," "batch size," "optimizer," "loss function."**]
* **For Unsupervised Learning (Anomaly Detection):**
    * The model is trained on data assumed to be [**E.g., "mostly normal/healthy."**]
    * It learns to [**What does the model learn to do? E.g., "identify outliers that deviate significantly from the learned normal patterns," or "cluster similar data points and flag those far from any cluster centroid."**].
    * [**Mention how anomalies are scored/detected. E.g., "An anomaly score is calculated for each data point, and a threshold is applied to classify anomalies."**]

### Anomaly Detection/Prediction Logic

Once trained, the model operates as follows:
1.  **Data Ingestion:** New telemetry data points are [**How are they ingested? E.g., "streamed into the system," "loaded from a file."**].
2.  **Preprocessing:** The same feature engineering steps applied during training are applied to the new data.
3.  **Prediction/Scoring:** The preprocessed data is fed into the trained ML model, which outputs [**What does it output? E.g., "an anomaly score," "a classification (normal/anomaly)," "a reconstruction error."**].
4.  **Thresholding/Interpretation:** [**Explain how the model's output is interpreted to declare an anomaly. E.g., "If the anomaly score exceeds a predefined threshold, the data point is flagged as anomalous."**]

## Getting Started

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* [**Python version, e.g., Python 3.8+**]
* [**List any other major dependencies, e.g., pip, Git**]
* [**Any OS-specific prerequisites, if applicable.**]

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Llalithsaikumar/telemetry_Analyzer.git](https://github.com/Llalithsaikumar/telemetry_Analyzer.git)
    cd telemetry_Analyzer
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    * **Note:** If `requirements.txt` is not present, you'll need to create it by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing your dependencies manually, or just list the key dependencies here for the user to install directly.

## Usage

This section details how to run and interact with the Telemetry Analyzer.

### [Option 1: Command Line Interface (CLI)]

[**If your project is runnable via CLI, provide specific commands and explanations.**]
